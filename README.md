# design gubbins (stream of consciousness for the design)
we are making a game that is about clicking on emotive text, weirdly emotive text.

the way it works is you click on some text that has an emotion displaying and you remove it from a text stream
so that so whoever's reading it later on isn't too upset or whatever idk it doesn't matter

FREAKY TEXT

angry text wibbles a lot
sad text wibbles slowly
happy text bounces from side to side happily

players click the text for points

points are used to buy stuff, we'll figure that out later

there will be incentives for when players click stuff so they aren't just clicking randomly, so we have to track
a game texts emotions

emotee's

## MVP
* a screen
* a single character 
  * that has an emotion
  * an animation
  * can be clicked
  * replaces itself with a neutral piece of text
* points must go up when the right emotion is picked
* a timer to tell the player which emotion to click
